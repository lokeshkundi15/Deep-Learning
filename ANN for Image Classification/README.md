# Multiclass Image Classification with ANN

## Overview
Classifies images into multiple categories using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

## Dataset
- Custom/prepared image dataset with multiple classes.
- Images preprocessed and flattened for ANN input.

## Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## Approach
1. Load and preprocess image data  
2. Build a fully connected ANN model  
3. Train, validate, and evaluate the model  

## Results
Achieved high accuracy in classifying images into multiple categories.

## How to Run
Open `Multiclass_Image_Classification_ANN.ipynb` and run all cells.
