# Binary Data Classification with ANN

## Overview
Performs binary classification on structured data using an Artificial Neural Network.

## Dataset
- Custom/prepared dataset with two classes.

## Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas.

## Approach
1. Load and normalize data  
2. Build ANN with dense layers  
3. Train and evaluate model  

## Results
Model effectively classifies binary data with good accuracy.

## How to Run
Open `Binary_Data_Classification_ANN.ipynb` and run all cells.
