# Object Recognition in Images with CNN

## Overview
Recognizes and classifies objects in images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Dataset
- Custom/prepared image dataset with labeled objects.

## Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## Approach
1. Load and preprocess image dataset  
2. Build CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers  
3. Train and evaluate model  

## Results
CNN achieved strong performance in object recognition tasks.

## How to Run
Open `Object_Recognition_CNN.ipynb` and run all cells.
