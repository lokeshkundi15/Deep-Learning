# Binary Image Classification with CNN

## Overview
Classifies images into two categories using Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Dataset
- Custom/prepared binary image dataset.

## Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## Approach
1. Image preprocessing and augmentation  
2. Build CNN model  
3. Train and evaluate model  

## Results
High accuracy in binary image classification.

## How to Run
Open `Binary_Image_Classification_CNN.ipynb` and run all cells.
