# Breast Cancer Detection with CNN

## Overview
Detects breast cancer from medical images using Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Dataset
- Custom/prepared image dataset of benign and malignant samples.

## Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## Approach
1. Load and preprocess medical images  
2. Build CNN model  
3. Train and evaluate model  

## Results
CNN effectively classifies cancerous vs non-cancerous images.

## How to Run
Open `Breast_Cancer_Detection_CNN.ipynb` and run all cells.
